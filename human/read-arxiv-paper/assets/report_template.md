## TL;DR (5–10 sentences)

Write a crisp summary that answers:
- What problem?
- What’s the one key idea?
- Why does it work?
- When would I use it?

## 1) The problem (and why it matters)

- Setting / motivation:
- Pain point:
- What is *not* solved by prior work:

## 2) Core idea (the “one trick”)

Explain the central mechanism with a small worked example.

### Minimal example

Describe a toy input and walk through the method step-by-step.

## 3) Method (precise, implementable)

### Inputs / outputs

- Inputs:
- Outputs:

### Algorithm sketch

Give pseudocode and name every important variable.

### Key design choices

For each design choice:
- What it is
- Why it helps
- What would happen if removed

## 4) Experiments (what to trust)

- Datasets / setup:
- Metrics:
- Main results:
- Ablations that matter:
- What looks suspicious / brittle:

## 5) Limitations + failure modes

- Assumptions:
- Where it breaks:
- Open questions:

## 6) Practical takeaways

### If I had 1 day
- The fastest reproduction / sanity-check:

### If I had 1 week
- The minimal good implementation:

### If I had 1 month
- Extensions worth trying:

## 7) Visual explanation (optional but recommended)

Add a figure that explains the method at a glance.

- Put images under `figures/`
- Reference them from this report (markdown image syntax)
- If useful, generate a schematic via `uv-scientific-schematics`

## 8) Notes and quotes (optional)

Only include short quotes; keep the rest paraphrased.
