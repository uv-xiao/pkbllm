# Design guidelines (adapted from archived v1)

This is a condensed synthesis of:

- an internal archived v1 workflow (removed from this repo)

## Slide-level principles

- **One message per slide** (avoid multi-concept dumping).
- **Visual hierarchy**: one dominant focal point; headline is the story.
- **Legibility first**: if key text becomes small, split the slide instead.
- **Whitespace is structure**: use consistent margins and spacing.
- **Consistency**: typography, icon style, box/arrow style, and highlight language should match across slides.

## Text density rules of thumb

- Prefer 3–5 bullets; each bullet is short.
- Replace paragraphs with a diagram/table/illustration when it improves comprehension.

## Data visualization basics

- Annotate the insight (do not expect the audience to “read the chart”).
- Highlight the key numbers/series; de-emphasize everything else.
- Use color consistently (one meaning per color).
