# Hands-on report

## What I ran

| Date | Command | Result summary | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {YYYY-MM-DD} | {command} | {1–2 sentence summary} | `results/{file_or_dir}` |

## Observations (tie each to evidence)

- {observation_1} (see `results/{...}`)
- {observation_2} (see `results/{...}`)

## Root-cause hypotheses

- {hypothesis}: {why you think so} (disprove by: {what evidence would falsify it})

## Next steps (actionable)

1) {next_step_1}
2) {next_step_2}
