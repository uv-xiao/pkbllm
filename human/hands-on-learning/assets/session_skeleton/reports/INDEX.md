# Hands-on session index

**Session:** {session_name}
**Repo:** {repo_url_or_path}
**Commit:** {git_sha_or_tag}

## Entry points

- Repo analysis: `../../repo_analysis.md`
- Environment: `environment.md`
- Plan: `plan.md`
- Report: `report.md`

## What to look at first

1) `report.md` (what actually happened)
2) `environment.md` (is the setup credible?)
3) `plan.md` (what was intended?)
4) `results/` logs and traces (raw evidence; gitignored)
