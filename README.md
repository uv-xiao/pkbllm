# Personal Knowledge Base in the LLM Era

## Background

Everyone uses LLM in their research or projects to boost productivity. I'm facing two troubles:

1. How to use LLM, especially coding agents (Codex, ...), better? 
2. How to keep in pace with LLM and make key decisions?

Both problems are severe.

1. **To make LLM better**: there must be good **Skills** to guide LLM work in a good way.
2. **To make human better also**: there must also be human-readable notes to help guys in.

This repo aims to provide and bridge both. The major contents are skills (Skills A-D):
- A. For domain knowledge, especially for codebase and papers.
- B. For productive usage, like being used for developing in a repository.
- C. For repo maintainance, including how to add new/update new skill.
- D. For human learning, such as generating notes/slides from knowledge.
