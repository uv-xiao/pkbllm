Use the $uv-verl-rl-training skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Provides guidance for training LLMs with reinforcement learning using verl (Volcano Engine RL). Use when implementing RLHF, GRPO, PPO, or other RL algorithms for LLM post-training at scale with flexible infrastructure backends.
