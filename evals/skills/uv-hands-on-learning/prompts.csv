Use the $uv-hands-on-learning skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Run a structured hands-on exploration session for an ML/LLM repository (setup, environment detection, experiment plan, execution, profiling, and reporting). Use when you want to validate performance claims, identify bottlenecks, reproduce benchmarks, or turn repo analysis into concrete experiments stored alongside the repo analysis report.

Task:
1) Create a tiny local git repo in the current directory:
   - `mkdir -p dummy_repo && git init dummy_repo`
2) Initialize a hands-on session under $HUMAN_MATERIAL_PATH for that repo:
   - `python human/hands-on-learning/scripts/init_hands_on_session.py ./dummy_repo --slug dummy --session test`

Then verify these files exist:
