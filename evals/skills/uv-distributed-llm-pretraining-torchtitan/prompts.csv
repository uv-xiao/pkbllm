Use the $uv-distributed-llm-pretraining-torchtitan skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Provides PyTorch-native distributed LLM pretraining using torchtitan with 4D parallelism (FSDP2, TP, PP, CP). Use when pretraining Llama 3.1, DeepSeek V3, or custom models at scale from 8 to 512+ GPUs with Float8, torch.compile, and distributed checkpointing.
