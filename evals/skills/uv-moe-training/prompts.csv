Return a JSON object that matches the provided output schema.

Use the $uv-moe-training skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Train Mixture of Experts (MoE) models using DeepSpeed or HuggingFace. Use when training large-scale models with limited compute (5× cost reduction vs dense models), implementing sparse architectures like Mixtral 8x7B or DeepSeek-V3, or scaling model capacity without proportional compute increase. Covers MoE architectures, routing mechanisms, load balancing, expert parallelism, and inference optimization.
