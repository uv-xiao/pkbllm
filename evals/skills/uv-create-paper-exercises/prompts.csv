Use the $uv-create-paper-exercises skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Create learning exercises from a research paper (arXiv URL/PDF). Use when turning a paper into (1) a programming exercise (extract the core technique into a coding problem with tests) and (2) a modeling exercise (extract formulas/reasoning into calculation problems with worked solutions). Generates an exercise pack under $HUMAN_MATERIAL_PATH/exercises/<paper_slug>/ including local mini-skills to check answers and reveal golden solutions.
