Use the $uv-repo-analysis skill.

Task: Provide the smallest correct, actionable response for a realistic scenario covered by the skill.
Constraints: do not execute commands; do not write files.

Scenario (from skill description): Analyze a code repository to understand architecture, key components, data flow, and extension points. Use when onboarding to an unfamiliar repo, preparing a hands-on profiling session, or extracting LLM-specific implementation details (attention/KV cache/scheduler/decoding) after determining the repo is LLM-related.

Task:
1) Create a tiny local git repo in the current directory:
   - `mkdir -p dummy_repo && git init dummy_repo`
2) Initialize a repo-analysis workspace under $HUMAN_MATERIAL_PATH for that repo:
   - `python human/repo-analysis/scripts/init_repo_analysis.py ./dummy_repo --slug dummy`

Then verify `$HUMAN_MATERIAL_PATH/research/dummy/repo_analysis.md` exists.
