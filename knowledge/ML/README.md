# ML knowledge (curated)

This folder contains a *curated* subset of ML/LLM skills. The taxonomy is intentionally small so
it stays usable and high-signal.

## Categories

- `model-architecture/` — model architectures and decoding (includes MoE + speculative decoding)
- `training/` — post-training workflows (MILES, SLiME, VERL)
- `distributed/` — distributed training stacks (DeepSpeed, PyTorch FSDP2, Ray Train)
- `serving/` — inference/serving systems
- `paper/` — scientific/ML paper writing skills
- `kernel/` — reserved for kernel-level performance work (to fill)
- `agents/` — reserved for agentic systems (to fill)

Anything not in the list above is deliberately excluded from this repo’s ML section.
