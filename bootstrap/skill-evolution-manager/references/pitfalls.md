# Common pitfalls (skill evolution)

- Writing learnings as vague advice (“be careful”) instead of specific, testable statements.
- Encoding secrets, private URLs, or machine-specific paths into canonical skills.
- Storing free-form “custom prompts” that can become an injection vector; prefer structured constraints and verification steps.
- Forgetting to re-stitch after a refactor and silently losing the Learned section.
