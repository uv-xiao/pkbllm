# Common pitfalls

- Writing a “concept essay” without runnable examples.
- Using placeholders or vague statements instead of concrete commands and outputs.
- Forgetting to link back to the repo analysis (reader loses code map).
- Exercises with no acceptance criteria (uncheckable).
- Not capturing expected output (reader can’t tell if their run is correct).
- Letting chapters sprawl: one chapter should teach one mental model + one concrete workflow.
- Mixing setup instructions across chapters (setup should be centralized and repeatable).
- Code tours with no “why”: listing files without explaining responsibilities wastes reader time.
- Exercises that depend on hidden context (make prerequisites explicit).
