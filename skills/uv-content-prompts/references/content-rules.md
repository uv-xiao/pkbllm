# Content rules (adapted from archived v1)

Condensed from:

- an internal archived v1 workflow (removed from this repo)

## Core rules

- **Respect attention**: one main idea per page; remove redundancy.
- **Traceability**: if you include stats, capture the source in the page notes.
- **No placeholders**: avoid “TBD”; if unknown, mark as TODO with what to fetch.
- **Narrative headlines**: titles should state the takeaway, not a category label.
- **No AI clichés**: avoid filler phrasing (“dive into”, “journey”, “exciting”).
