# Skills (distribution)

This folder is the distribution surface for the Skills CLI (`npx skills`).

- Each direct child directory is a skill.
- Contents are generated from the canonical categorized directories:
  `knowledge/`, `productivity/`, and `human/`.

Do not edit skills here by hand; edit the canonical skill and re-sync.
